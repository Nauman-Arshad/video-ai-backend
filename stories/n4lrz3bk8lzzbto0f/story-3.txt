The city of Welland has stated that the tree carvings have not only caused physical damage but also affect the overall tree canopy that provides shade, oxygen, and habitat for wildlife. The cost to replace the damaged trees is estimated to be up to $8,000, which will be covered by taxpayers. The man responsible for the carvings is facing charges and is currently in jail awaiting a bail hearing.
