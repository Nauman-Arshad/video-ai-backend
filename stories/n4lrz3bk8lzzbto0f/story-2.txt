The Welland Downtown Business Improvement Area described the carvings as 'unique carving pieces' on social media, but city officials have stated that the cuts are detrimental to the trees and the overall tree canopy. The trees affected include Norway and Manitoba maples and five poplar trees. The man arrested is being held in jail until a bail hearing next week. The police investigation began last month after the carvings were discovered.
