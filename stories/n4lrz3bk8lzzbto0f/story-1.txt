Niagara police have arrested a 40-year-old man from Welland, Ont., for carving haunting faces into seven trees near Welland's Civic Square. The man has been charged with mischief over $5,000 and failing to comply with a bail condition in an unrelated case. The carvings, which appeared in July 2024, have caused irreversible damage to the trees, disrupting their ability to transport nutrients and making them more susceptible to diseases and pests. The city anticipates needing to replace the trees in a few years, costing taxpayers up to $8,000.
